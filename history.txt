This history file covers all modifications made to ECMNet Client/Server.

Version 3.0.5:  September 20, 2013 - Patch Release
     ecmadmin:  Add option 7, ability to send curves from a file.  Each row of the 
                file must be in the format:
                   <candidate name> <factor method> <curves> <b1>
    ecmclient:  Fixed getting maxmem setting from the ini file.
                Parse out colon in sigma value for GMP-ECM 7.
    ecmserver:  Add e-mail address to server log when sending/receiving work.
                Support getting curve counts from ecmadmin.
                Don't error if SMTP server returns a 252.


Version 3.0.4:  September 10, 2013 - Patch Release
          all:  Change function parameters from char to const char where necessary.
                Use Socket class from PRPNet.
                Use PRId64 and PRIu64 instead of %lld and %llu


Version 3.0.3:  September 6, 2013 - Patch Release
          all:  Updated to Visual Studio 2010.
                Fixed makefile issues.
    ecmserver:  Merged DBInterface and SQLStatement classes with PRPNet sources.


Version 3.0.2:  July 2011 - Patch Release
    ecmserver:  Re-wrote master/slave processing because original code didn't
                handle multiple slaves well and could have had issues due to
                the multi-threading of the server.
                If you had installed 3.0.1 or 3.0.0, you need to run the
                upgrade_301_to_302.sql script and create the MasterCompositeSlaveSync
                table whose script is in the appropriate create_tables.sql file.


Version 3.0.1:  May 2011 - Patch Release
          all:  Added 64-bit Windows configurations
    ecmserver:  Now supports dsn based ODBC connections.
                Added version of create_tables script that works on PostgreSQL.


Version 3.0.0:  May 2011 - New Release
          all:  New socket protocol.
                Removed sbfactor support.

    ecmserver:  Completely re-architected to support MySQL and multi-threading.
                Read the readme_upgrade.txt file to learn how to upgrade.
                3.x server compatible with 2.x clients.
                Use GMP-ECM expression evaluator for computing decimal lengths of composites.
                Master/slave between 3.x servers works, but a 3.x server cannot
                communicate with a 2.x server.  This is unlikely to be fixed because
                when 3.x and 2.x are mixed, then only one side is using database
                transactions.  Also, the 3.x server collects a lot more information than
                the 2.x server has available to it.
                Re-read the ini file once every 256 seconds to pick up changes in debuglevel.           
                Collect more statistics and report them to the server, such as total time
                spent doing factoring work in addition to B2 and individual B1/B2 times
                for each factor found.
                server_stats.html now lists current B1 rather than all factoring work done.
                Replaced server_stats.html with composites_summary.html.
                Added composites_work.html, which has displays factoring work done on each
                composite that is active.
                Added master_summary.html, which is a summary of all master composites.
                Added factor_summary.html, which is summary of all factors.
                Added user_stats.html.

    ecmclient:  New format for work_xx.save files.
                Can run muptiple copies of the client from a single folder using the
                -id option.  This overrides clientid in the ecmclient.ini file.
                Re-read the ini file after every curve to pick up changes in debuglevel.
                Add startoption, stopoption, and stopasaption to ini file.
                Collect more statistics and report them to the server, such as total time
                spent doing factoring work in addition to B2 and individual B1/B2 times
                for each factor found.


Version 2.7.3:  October 2006
    ecmserver:  Fixed an array out of bounds error in Candidate.cpp
                when P+1/P-1 depth over ECM extended beyond
                table of B1 values from ecmserver.b1 file.
                Add support for ecmserver.ini file that contains
                expressions only (which in turn will build a
                valid ecmserver.ini file with dummy entry names)

Version 2.7.2:  June 2006
    ecmclient:  Made a change to FindNextServerForWork in case which
                is used when a server is not available.  It will
                increase the probability that a server with a lower
                percentage will get work.
    ecmserver:  Added SplitAcrossLines() prototype to Candidate.h
                Fixed BuildHTMLTable as P+1/P-1 were reversed.
          all:  Changed portID to a short from an int to eliminate
                warnings.
          all:  Fixed makefile so that it links on Solaris

Version 2.7.1:  February 2006
    ecmserver:  Fixed a bug in Mail.cpp where mail would not be sent to
                other recipients as specified on the destid= lines
                in ecmserver.cfg
                Fixed a bug in Candidate.cpp where factors that had 
                already been found would be logged when the server would
                be restarted.
                Add factor/co-factor lengths in text of e-mail.
                Indicate in e-mail if the factor was already known.
                In some cases an e-mail would be sent if a new factor
                could not be added.  This has been fixed.
                Added support to build HTML output from the ecmserver.ini
                when calling with "GET" via a browser.
                Fixed a bug where a new Candidate from the master server
                would not set the server type.
        other:  Updated ecmserver.b1.gmpecm to use GMP-ECM curve counts.
                
Version 2.7.0:  December 2005
    ecmserver:  Log factors found by a slave to Factors.log.
                Fix bug when logging message if work could not be sent
                to the calling client.
          all:  Add BUFFER_SIZE to defs.h to allow easy configuration for
                message sizes.
                Exit in Socket.cpp if the message from the client is
                longer than BUFFER_SIZE to prevent a possible segfault.

Version 2.6.4:  July 2005
    ecmserver:  Fix an issue with master/slave communication where a factor
                cannot be sent between them.

Version 2.6.3:  June 2005
    ecmserver - Fix a typo from 2.6.2 release.

Version 2.6.2:  June 2005
    ecmserver - Accept work from a client if the candidate is not found,
                but do nothing with it so that the client can get more work.

Version 2.6.1:  May 2005
    ecmserver - Fixed an issue that caused e-mail to not get sent when first
                factor is found by the server.

Version 2.6.0:  April 2005
    ecmclient - Added debuglevel configuration option along with -debuglevel
                command line parameter 
                Send client version to server in RETURNWORK and RETURNFACTOR
                Get version of GMP-ECM before loading work_xxx.save so that
                next GetWork can send version to server.
    ecmserver - Added debuglevel configuration option along with -debuglevel
                command line parameter 
                Detect error condition on RETURNWORK and RETURNFACTOR when
                the ECMname is not returned in the message.
                Modify CompareB1() to compare curves left if B1s are the same.
                Handle condition when versions are not sent by client on
                GETWORK to prevent segfault.
                If the server is a slave and the ecmserver.ini is missing or
                empty, then sync immediately with the master server so that
                it can be populated.  As the sync functionality has changed
                both master and slave servers have to be updated at the
                same time.

Version 2.5.8:  March 2005
    ecmclient - Fix a bug in Work.cpp (introduced in this release) that
                causes the client to rarely (if ever) find a factor.

Version 2.5.7:  March 2005
    ecmclient - Fix a formatting bug in Work.Load() that causes a crash when 
                the save file and server/port do not match configuration.
                Change message "Did xxx curves" to "Did xxx of xxx curves".
                Do not allow embedded ':' or ' ' in machine ID so that
                server doesn't parse it incorrectly.
    ecmserver - Fix problem that causes ADMIN_NEW to be rejected.
                Change atol to atof when getting g_MaxB1 from ecmserver.b1.
                Address potential buffer overflow by limiting FROM message
                to 200 bytes.
                Use either ':' or ' ' as a terminator for the machine ID
                as those characters cause problems later in the code.
                Fix a potential issue in the server selecting the wrong
                B1 or in sending 0 curves to the client for ECM factoring.
                Fix an issue in CompareWork and CompareDifficulty where
                conversion from double to long sometimes results with the
                long having the wrong sign.
                Add more debug information in assignment selection.
    ecmadmin  - Include <signal.h> on UNIX systems.
                Fixed the ecmadmin.dsp project for Visual C++ so that it
                builds correctly.

                Add machine ID to factor_t structure.
                Fix segfault caused by double free in SaveCandidates.
    ecmclient - Fix memory leak that causes segfault in ExtractFactorGMP.

Version 2.5.3:  October 2004 (beta)
    ecmserver - Return an error if the server cannot assign work for the client.
    ecmclient - Fix an infinite loop caused when factoring returns the input
                number.

Version 2.5.2:  October 2004 (beta)
    ecmserver - Fixed issue where duplicate factors were not being flagged
                Calculate work done in constructor of Candidate.cpp as
                the new candidate might have been created via recursion
    ecmclient - Return RC_FAILURE from FindAnyIncomplete work to avoid loop

Version 2.5.1:  October 2004 (beta)
    all       - Modified code to eliminate all compiler warnings.

    ecmserver - Fixed issue where factor method was not returned to the client.
                Fixed sorting for B1 sort type.
                Added total work as secondary sort parameter when B1 or length
                are the same.

    ecmadmin  - Added the ability to submit a factor.
                Removed functionality that was only needed by old client.
                Require a password for all server functions.

    ecmclient - Removed user statistics, i.e. the .crv and .daily files will
                no longer be created or updated.
                Removed admin functions and put them into ecmadmin.
                Support to send client version to server.
                Support to receive server version from server.
                Support to do P+1/P-1 factoring as determined by the server.
                Added signal handling to reduce the possibility of the client
                crashing the server if the user tries to quit the client while a
                socket is open with the server.
                Support for communication with multiple servers.

                socket is open with the server.
                Add new servertype parameter so that server can assign work
                for SBFACTOR.
