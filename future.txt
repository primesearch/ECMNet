This is a list of future features to be considered for ECMNet.

1)  Support msieve (in the client) to factor composites under a certain length.

As much as some people might like to see it, the client will not support GGNFS
in the forseeable future because it requires a certain amount of configuration.

If you have anything else you would like to see added, please contact me at
rogue@wi.rr.com.
