Getting work:
   to server:  "FROM <email> <client> <user> <client_version>"
   to client:  "Connected to server version <server_version>"
   to server:  "GETWORK <client_version> <gmp-ecm version>"
   to client:  one or more of:  "Factoring Work for <composite name> <composite value> <decimal length> <factor method> <b1> <curves to do> <string length of composite value>"
               ending with:     "End of Message"
   to client:  "Start Greeting"
               <text from file Greeting.txt>
               "End Greeting"
      
1)  The <string length of composite value> is just strlen(composite value).  This is sent so that the client can verify
    that it got the entire composite value, which is helpful if the value is very long.  The composite value can be an
    expression.  This will return the strlen of the expression, not the decimal expansion of the expression. 
2)  The client does not send verification to the server that it got the workunits.  In the unfortunate case that 
    happens, the server has the ability to expire work.
3)  The server can also send "INACTIVE" or "INFO" to the client to indicate that there is no work to be done.

Returning work:
   to server:  "FROM <email> <client> <user> <client_version>"
   to client:  "Connected to server version <server_version>"
   to server:  "Start Return"

               For each composite:
   to server:  "Abandon Work for <composite name> <factor method> <b1>"

                or

   to server:  "Return Work for <composite name> <composite value> <factor method> <factor is number> <b1> <curves done> <b1 + b2 time> <string length of composite value>"

               If a factor was found, then these are also sent:
               "Return Factor Event for <composite name> <factor method> <factor step> <b1> <b1 time> <b2> <b2 time> <sigma> <x0>"
               "Return Factor Event Detail for <composite name> <factor value> <factor type>"
               "Return Factor Event Detail for <composite name> <factor value> <factor type>"

               This is always sent:
               "End Return Work for <composite name>"
   to client:  "Accepted Work for %s"

               When the client has no more work to send
   to server:  "End of Return Work"

1)  <factor is number> indicates that GMP-ECM determined that the composite was PRP or that B1 was too large to properly factor the number.
2)  <factor type> indicates PRP, prime, or composite.  This is provided by GMP-ECM.  Whether or not it is recursed as a new composite is
    based upon a PRP test done by the server (using mpz_probab_prime) and if the server is configured to recurse.  In a master/slave
    configuration, only the master will recurse the composite factors and the slave will get the new composite the next time it syncs.
